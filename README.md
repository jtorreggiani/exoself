# Exoself

Exoself is a virtual assistant program designed to assist users in a wide range of tasks, including answering questions and engaging in natural-sounding conversations on various topics. It uses OpenAI's GPT-3 language model, allowing it to generate human-like text and respond coherently and relevantly to the input received. Exoself learns about its user and can go into "mirror" mode to emulate the user.

**This to consider before using Exoself:**

## Features

Exoself offers the following features:

- **Assistant Mode**: In this mode, Exoself responds as an AI assistant and provides information and answers to questions to the best of its ability. It is the default mode in which Exoself starts.
- **Mirror Mode**: In this mode, Exoself responds as the user based on all the information it is provided.
- **Debug Mode**: In this mode, Exoself responds as the untrained prompted GPT-3 model without any prompts.

Currently, when the user prompts Exoself, it is fed the current time, which it uses to perform certain time-based operations such as scheduling and reminders. However, as a virtual assistant that uses OpenAI's GPT-3 language model, Exoself's knowledge is limited to information that was available up until 2021. Therefore, if you ask Exoself about events or information that occurred after 2021, it may not have the most up-to-date information. However, Exoself can still provide valuable insights and information on a wide range of topics based on the information it has learned up until 2021.

## Operation

Exoself operates by processing the input it receives and using its knowledge to generate responses. It constantly learns and improves its abilities to understand and process vast amounts of information to offer informative and accurate responses. Exoself can generate its text based on the input it receives and engage in discussions on a broad range of subjects.

## Usage

To use Exoself, run the program and input your query or prompt. Exoself will then respond based on the mode it is in and the information provided. The default mode is Assistant Mode, but you can switch to Mirror Mode or Debug Mode if needed.
